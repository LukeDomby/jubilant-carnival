I would like to make a website called easyMoney where people send me money for free

### Security
I will implement the backend to use usernames and passwords to protect accounts. This will also extend the backend further to provide protection against money laundering, packet sniffing, and other things that may happen while the money is in transit.

It will use an MIT license
